Choice App is a webapp for teams to easily poll choices and get feedback from each member of the team.

## Making a Choice
First, click on the "Create Choice" button in the top left corner of the screen. When the page loads, fill out the form with all the information for your Choice. This includes the number of members in your team, the description of your choice, and 2-5 possible alternatives for the choice. Once the form is filled out, hit the "Create Choice" button at the bottom and wait for your Choice ID to be generated. Copy this Choice ID and send it out to all the members of your team so they can access the choice.

## Viewing a choice
Once you have a Choice ID, you can participate in the choice and give your opinion. First, click go to the login page. Once there, fill in the username you would like to use for this choice and the Choice ID for the choice. If you would like, you can also fill in a password to use every time you login to view this particular choice. Once you have filled in the information, click the "Login" button and you can participate in the choice.

## Participating in a choice
Once you are viewing the choice you want to participate in, you can go through and approve or disapprove of the different alternatives. To approve an alternative, scroll to that particular alternative and hit the "Approve" button. After a few seconds, the page should reload, showing your username among the list of approvers for that alternative. If you would like to remove your approval from an alternative, simply click the "Approve" button again and once the page refreshes, your name will have been removed from the list of approvers.

The same process applies for disapproving an alternative. Simply hit the "Disapprove" button, and once the page reloads, your username will show among the list of disapprovers for that alternative. If you would like to remove your disapproval from an alternative, simply click the "Disapprove" button again and once the page refreshes, your name will have been removed from the list of disapprovers.

You can approve or disapprove of all the alternatives for a given choice.

To view the most current list of approvers and disapprovers for each alternative, refresh the page.
